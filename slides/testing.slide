* This talk will not teach you Go

But there are great resources on it, and they have great documentation.

.link http://golang.org golang.org

This talk will include:

- Formatting Test Output
- Testing asynchronous tasks
- Mocking out services in your tests
- GoConvey
- Q&A

* But first... a few public service annoucements

* Get on Gopher Slack

.link http://bit.ly/go-slack-signup http://bit.ly/go-slack-signup

After Signing Up:

.link https://gophers.slack.com/messages/minneapolis/ https://gophers.slack.com/messages/minneapolis/

We will use the Chicago channel to share links for the presentation.

* OSS Help Wanted Go Projects

This repo contains many Go projects that have issues labeled with easy/medium/hard.  Great resource for learning Go
while solving real world problems.

* Formatting Test Output

* Testing output - Poor

.code ../code/testing/math/math_test.go /START POOR-OMIT/,/END POOR-OMIT/

*Output*

	--- FAIL: Test_AddTen (0.00s)
		math_test.go:13: unexpected value

* Testing output - Better

.code ../code/testing/math/math_test.go /START BETTER-OMIT/,/END BETTER-OMIT/

*Output*

	--- FAIL: Test_AddTenBetter (0.00s)
		math_test.go:23: unexpected value, got 12

* Testing output - Better Yet

.code ../code/testing/math/math_test.go /START BETTER-YET-OMIT/,/END BETTER-YET-OMIT/

*Output*

	--- FAIL: Test_AddTenBetterYet (0.00s)
		math_test.go:33: unexpected value, exp: 11, got 12

* Testing output - Best

.code ../code/testing/math/math_test.go /START BEST-OMIT/,/END BEST-OMIT/

*Output*

	--- FAIL: Test_AddTenBest (0.00s)
		math_test.go:42: unexpected value, exp: 11, got 12

*NOTE:* Not all my colleagues agree with me that this is the best.

* Testing asynchronous tasks

* What is asynchronous?

Many times you may be testing parts of your code that have service dependency that run for an unknown amount of time.

Examples of these may be task queues, distributed system calls, etc.

Because you don't know how long they may take to execute, testing them can present some challenges.

* The Use Case

In this use case, we have a database that will accept data via an http endpoint and que them to write to the database.

Issues:

- We don't know how long it will take for the value to be written to the database
- It could fail and never be written, so we need to be able to time out the test

* time.Sleep

.code ../code/testing/coupled/httpd/handler_test.go /START SLEEP-OMIT/,/END SLEEP-OMIT/

* time.Sleep issues

- Doesn't allow us to time out, will likely result in intermittent test failures
- Bloats testing time for no good reason.
- Usually ends up resulting in a really really big timeout to avoid intermittent test results

* Channels to the rescue!

- Result in much lower test time bloat
- Allows us to time out the test

* Setting up the test channels

.code ../code/testing/coupled/httpd/handler_test.go /START CHANNEL-SETUP-OMIT/,/END CHANNEL-SETUP-OMIT/

* Looping the test

.code ../code/testing/coupled/httpd/handler_test.go /START CHANNEL-OMIT/,/END CHANNEL-OMIT/

* The inner test

.code ../code/testing/coupled/httpd/handler_test.go /START FUNC-INNER-OMIT/,/END FUNC-INNER-OMIT/

* Decoupling your code for testing

* Too many dependencies already

Currently to test an http endpoint, we require an actual `keys.Store`.  That is because the code is tightly coupled.

* Tightly Coupled

.code ../code/testing/coupled/main.go /START COUPLED-OMIT/,/END COUPLED-OMIT/

.code ../code/testing/coupled/httpd/handler.go /START COUPLED-OMIT/,/END COUPLED-OMIT/

* Loosely Coupled

.code ../code/testing/decoupled/main.go /START DECOUPLED-OMIT/,/END DECOUPLED-OMIT/

.code ../code/testing/decoupled/httpd/handler.go /START DECOUPLED-OMIT/,/END DECOUPLED-OMIT/

* Ok, so it's loosely coupled now, what did I gain?

* Mocking out services in your tests

* The Mock

.code ../code/testing/decoupled/httpd/handler_test.go /START MOCK-OMIT/,/END MOCK-OMIT/

* Test Setup with Mock

.code ../code/testing/decoupled/httpd/handler_test.go /START MOCK-SETUP-OMIT/,/END MOCK-SETUP-OMIT/

* We Came, We Decoupled, We Mocked Out!

- No longer dependent on services outside our package for testing.
- Can easily test all code branches of our package, including all error conditions


* Test Options

* Testing Options: -v

Verbose: `-v` is very useful when you want to see all the test logging.  This is common when running
tests on automated testing platforms such as jenkins, circle, etc.

	go test ./code/testing/... -v

* Testing Options: Run a specific test (Regex)

This will run any test that starts with `Test_Upsert`

	go test ./code/testing/... -run Test_Upsert

Useful for running just a few tests when refactoring or TDD'ing

* Testing Options: Set a test timeout


	go test ./code/testing/... -timeout 10s

Always run this for your automated testing.  If/when your code deadlocks, it will time out and provide a stack trace of the routines to assist in debugging.



* Test Coverage

My typical script:

	echo "creating coverage files"
	go test -coverprofile=/tmp/coverage.out
	go tool cover -html=/tmp/coverage.out -o /tmp/coverage.html
	echo "coverage files created"

* How did we do?

.image ../img/testing/coverage.png

* Some lightweight automation

.link https://github.com/cespare/reflex reflex

Reflex is a small tool to watch a directory and rerun a command when certain files change. It's great for automatically running compile/lint/test tasks and for reloading your application when the code changes.

I run coverage for packages with this command:

	reflex -- sh ~/coverage.sh

* Pro Tip

You can turn of the garbage collector to run tests.  This will speed up testing significantly.

Do NOT do this for benchmarking!

	GOGC=off go test ./...

Note: I turn of GC for creating coverage files as well...

* GoConvey

.link https://github.com/smartystreets/goconvey GoConvey

 	go get github.com/smartystreets/goconvey
	# from the project root run:
	goconvey

* GoConvey Features

- Directly integrates with go test
- Fully-automatic web UI (works with native Go tests, too)
- Huge suite of regression tests
- Shows test coverage (Go 1.2+)
- Readable, colorized console output (understandable by any manager, IT or not)
- Test code generator
- Desktop notifications (optional)
- Immediately open problem lines in Sublime Text (some assembly required)
